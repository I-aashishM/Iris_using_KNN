# Iris_using_KNN

Lets start with supervised learning algorithm, called KNN (k-nearest neighbors algorithm). I stared with iris dataset which is avaliable on sklean.datasets

If you need dataset file (csv), link : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

The goal is to fit the model, find the acuracy and predit the flower.

Operating System : windows 10
Programming Language : python 3.7

Modules : sklearn.datasets, Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.neighbors

Model acuracy : 97.36842105263158

Features/X is in data column.

Target/y is in target column.
